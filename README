Introduction
------------

I have update apxml to work easily with ARC. It is an extremely straightforward way to create XML Documents.

Getting Started
---------------
To use APXML in your project, just copy the Objective-C files into your Xcode project
and put:

#import "APXML.h"

at the top of any file you intend on using APXML in.
