Introduction
------------
I wrote APXML so I could manipulate XML more easily in the programs I write
for iPhone and iPod Touch. I'm putting it out here in hopes that it will help
others too. For more information, check out http://arashpayan.com/projects/APXML/

Getting Started
---------------
To use APXML in your project, just copy the Objective-C files into your Xcode project
and put:

#import "APXML.h"

at the top of any file you intend on using APXML in.
